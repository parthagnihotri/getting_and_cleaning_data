# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project 

This repository is created to store R code and documentation files for the "Getting and Cleaning data" course project. 
 
Data for the project has been downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. Data files from downloaded zip file needs to be extracted in R working directory. 

## R Code 

**run_analysis.R** script performs following steps to generate the tidy dataset and the text file. run_analysis.R file should be copied to R working directory and executed from there. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets for Subject, Activity and Features to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set using the activity names labels.
4. Sets appropriate labels for the data set with descriptive variable names using features labels. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Creates text file for the data set created in step 5.

## Code Book 

**codeBook.md** file has the details about the data sets and the variables.

## Tidy Data text file

**tidayData.txt** is the output text file generated by executing run_analysis.R script.
